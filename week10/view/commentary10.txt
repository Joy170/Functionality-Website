Commentary week 10: 
The evaluation for this week is to describe the structure of RSS and then to show how you have created your RSS feed within your site.
I used XML to create my RSS feed. The version of RSS used in 2.0 which is stated at the top of the program. The RSS feed is broken down into different items that contain the title, the description, the link, the last publication date and global unique identifier(guid). Each item tag includes one specific article that is available on my website. The title tag contains the title for the item, the description tag will be a short introduction to the content of the article. The link tag will define which article is going to be linked to. Lastly the guid will uniquely identify this item from the others. The channel tag encloses the items as this is the tag that defines the data that is contained in the RSS feed. 
The users who want to subscribe to the RSS feed on my site can do so by clicking on the button clearly labeled “Subscribe to my RSS feed” on the right-hand side at the top of my webpage. When users click on this button, they will either see an XML file or if they have an RSS reader installed, will see the items contained in the RSS feed, which are my articles that exist on my website.
To be able to create my RSS feed I installed an RSS Reader and subscribed to an outside RSS feed to see how this worked. Once I understood the function of an RSS feed, I tried to implement this onto my site. I used SKY NEWS RSS feeds XML as an example to set up my RSS feed. I matched the appropriate tags I needed for my RSS feed explained above with the data found in my articles. By looking at the example this gave me a strong idea how to set up each item in the format of an RSS feed and helped me understand the important tags needed to set up information such as the RSS title.
